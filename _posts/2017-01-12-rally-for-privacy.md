Come be a part of the first organized resistance to LinkNYC! On Thursday Jan 12th LinkNYC Kiosk will come to life and dialogue with New Yorkers over lunch hour. We are staging a street theater intervention to raise questions about kiosk surveillance. 

Link NYC kiosks are springing up all over the city. They are marketed as “free” public wifi and a general public service. We are not being told that LinkNYC is tracking New Yorkers movements, association patterns, browser habits, and online activities. 

RethnkLinkNYC is a group of concerned citizens whi are demanding to Rethink the Link.nyc program. We believe LinkNYC is not true community wifi. Instead, LinkNYC is mass surveillance and corporate profit boxed and marketed as free wifi. True community WiFi unites and connects people. It affirms freedom, openness and trust.
