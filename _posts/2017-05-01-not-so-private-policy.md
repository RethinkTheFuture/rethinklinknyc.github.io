On March 17th LinkNYC issued a long-overdue update to their [privacy policy](https://link.nyc/privacy-policy.html), a full year after the NYCLU wrote an open letter demanding clarification to flagrant privacy infringements - https://www.nyclu.org/en/press-releases/nyclu-citys-public-wi-fi-raises-privacy-concerns.

The new privacy policy falls far short of making us feel safe on our streets. After careful review of the policy changes, Rethink LinkNYC believes that this cosmetic update is designed reassure the public that LinkNYC is taking privacy concerns seriously. 

Even the best privacy policy is worthless without oversight or accountability, and we demand a citizen-run governance processes to enforce compliance. The LinkNYC policy can be updated at any time, and its permanence should be stated in the charter.
 
You can review the old privacy policy on the Internet Archive - https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20161021131447/https://link.nyc/privacy-policy.html.  We began our analysis by reviewing the differences between the old and the new policies: https://www.diffchecker.com/haMx1arr

We closely analyzed the differences and have assembled our critiques to the policy as annotations to the policy itself: - hypothes.is link.

The most absurd part of this rewrite is that the Mayor's Office has issued guidelines for the Internet of Things -  https://iot.cityofnewyork.us/privacy-and-transparency/ - , which are far more stringent and respectful of citizen data than the brand new LinkNYC policy.  These proposed IoT guidelines commit "to being open and transparent about the “who, what, where, when, why and how” of data collection, transmission, processing and use."
