RethinkLink.NYC was spotlighted in the March 2017 issue of The Indypendant, #222:

[Not Your Grandpa's Payphone](https://www.indypendent.org/2017/02/21/not-your-grandpas-payphone).

We are excited to see resistance continuing to build around the relentless encroachemts on our privacy. Please spread this story with your friends and co-workers.

We would like to thank the Indypendant and Jesse Rubbin for their commitment to covering this important issue.
