**Why is LinkNYC such a problem?**

LinkNYC does nothing to address to the digital divide. Instead, it subjects us to surveillance and invades our privacy by collecting data about us by tracking New Yorkers’ movements, association patterns, browser habits, and online activities. That data can be:
* used by corporations to bombard us with targeted advertising that turns our private habits into public electronic billboard ads. 
* used by the NYPD and the other state agencies to racially profile and further harass marginalized communities. 
* a rich target for hackers.

The only area that has been opted out from LinkNYC’s targeted advertising based on your identifying information, is Staten Island, the area where a high concentration of the city’s police force lives. In fact, Staten Island, where Eric Garner was [murdered with a chokehold by a police officer](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/black-lives-matter-11-racist-police-killings-with-no-justice-served-20141204), is also home to the [highest number of most-sued NYPD officers](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/staten-island-highest-number-most-sued-nypd-officers-article-1.1882160).

**Corporate surveillance**
*Business Insider* says that the booths will collect neighborhood-specific data. A representative from Intersection, the [parent company of LinkNYC](/pages/Who-owns-link) has [commented](http://www.businessinsider.com/inside-linknycs-free-public-gigabit-wifi-plan-2016-2) that it will use LinkNYC to "gain insights into how people use the network and how people move through the city." The company, which is owned by Google, plans to build neighborhood profiles that can be sold to advertisers. 

In other words, you are the product. 

Google has not categorically ruled out individual-level surveillance of users of LinkNYC with a representative of its subsidiary opting only to say that it is “not currently part of the strategy." But, given the lack of clarity on the policies the govern LinkNYC, it could be. The New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) wrote an [open letter](http://www.nyclu.org/files/releases/city%20wifi%20letter.pdf) to Mayor DeBlasio demanding clarification of these policies. It has gone unanswered.

**State surveillance**

The Snowden revelations about the NSA’s mass surveillance are only the latest chapter in a long history of state surveillance, one that has disproportionately affected marginalized communities and communities of color. Among other tactics, the surveillance of the marginalized has included mapping communities, tracking individuals, racially profiling, and building neighborhood and community profiles. 

Since at least 2002, the New York City police has deployed these methods to engage in what the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) calls “[suspicionless surveillance](https://www.aclu.org/other/factsheet-nypd-muslim-surveillance-program)” of Muslims. 

This overlaps with a longer history of surveillance of the Black community and protest movements in the U.S. [surveillance of the Black community](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/02/history-surveillance-and-black-community) and the [criminalization](https://policy.m4bl.org/political-power/) of Black political sphere. 

Finally, low-income and working class communities who conduct their social or daily activities in public spaces like parks, streets and stoops, disproportionately bear the brunt of this surveillance. Gated communities and rich neighborhoods with ample private space often escape the often escape the monitoring and punishment meted out marginalized communities for the same actions.

Private companies like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have _already_ assisted state agencies with surveilling their users. In October 2016, [ACLU revealed](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/aclu-exposes-facebook-twitter-for-selling-surveillance-company-user-data/) that these companies fed users’ streams to a Chicago-based company that then sold that data to police and other surveillance agencies. In fact, the data was [specifically marketed](https://www.aclunc.org/blog/facebook-instagram-and-twitter-provided-data-access-surveillance-product-marketed-target) as a way to target Black activists and activists of color. 

Moreover, the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act  (CALEA) requires telecommunications, VoIP traffic (like Skype) and broadband Internet corporations to assist law enforcement agencies in electronic surveillance. Specifically, CALEA ensures that these companies build and modify their equipment so that it is surveillance-ready. The government has yet to clarify whether LinkNYC falls under this Act. 

Given the history of surveillance in the U.S. and the willingness of corporations to enable state surveillance, LinkNYC looks increasingly like a corporate-state partnership to track, surveil and monitor the rest of us. 

The NSA invaded our online worlds. Now, Google is bringing that model to your street. 

Say no to LinkNYC. [Rethink Link](/pages/take-action) .
