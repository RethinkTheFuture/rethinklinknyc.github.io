### Our demands, Your rights

- **Halt construction immediately.**
  - We, as New Yorkers need to know what is being done in our name. And, we have questions. [HYPERLINK]

- **Remove surveillance cameras and bluetooth beacons immediately.**
 - Kiosks do not need to have cameras and blue tooth chips to bridge the digital divide.
 - Information about New Yorkers movements on- or off-line should not be monetized for corporate profit.  
 
- **Clarify the contract.**
 - answer our fucking questions

- **Provide genuine community WiFi to low-income communities -- without the surveillance.**
  - Free public Wi-Fi system that gives to the community rather than taking from it. We want public information services that  do not compromise citizen privacy.
  - People-focsed rather than profit-driven design. 
  - Here's a brief list of alternatives [HYPERLINK}

- **Institute public oversight for any and all community WiFi projects.**
  - New Yorkers want control over the wholsale sellout of personal data. We demand that no data should be collected by corporations without our explicitly opting in.
