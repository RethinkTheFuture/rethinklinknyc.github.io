### Our demands, Your rights

- **Halt construction immediately.**
  - We, as New Yorkers need to know what is being done in our name. And, we have questions. [HYPERLINK]

- **Remove surveillance cameras and bluetooth beacons immediately.**
  - Kiosks do not need to have cameras and blue tooth chips to provide WiFi.
  - Information about New Yorkers' movements on- or off-line should not be monetized for corporate profit.  
 
- **Answer the public's questions**
  -Supposedly LinkNYC is in a Beta phase, but it's not clear how CityBridge is collecting feedback on the current kiosks. We (and the New York Civil Liberties Union) have questions about the terms of use...and a whole lot more.

- **Provide genuine community WiFi (especially to low-income communities) -- without the surveillance.**
  - Create a public WiFi system that gives to the community rather than taking from it and do not compromise citizen's privacy.
  - People-focused rather than profit-driven design. 
  - Here's a brief list of alternatives: [NYC Mesh](https://nycmesh.net/), [Red Hook Wifi](http://redhookwifi.org/), [Free Harlem Wifi](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/fund/initiatives/free-harlem-wifi.page)


- **Institute public oversight for any and all community WiFi projects.**
  - New Yorkers want control over the shape of New York's digital future.
